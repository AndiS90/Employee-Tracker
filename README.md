  - Once installed, and you've navigated to the local directory containing the application within your terminal, it may be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

To seed it with my starter data first, log into mysql via

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
and enter your password, then

```bash
source db/schema.sql; 
```

and finally

```bash
source db/seeds.sql;
```
